        <p id="parastyle">Every media company sets out to tell a story.
             But there’s a big difference between telling
              the same story and finding the underreported 
              angle that’s often overlooked. That’s what we
              do at Big Edition. Our digital media company’s
               five brands focus on reporting the smaller 
               stories that spark conversations, widen 
               perspectives and build communities of 
               like-minded readers. This modern take on 
               traditional media is about delivering that 
               classic Sunday newspaper experience — online.
                Flip to the sports or travel verticals. Read
                 stories about the people and movements 
                 shaping our world. There’s something 
                 for every interest, big or small.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align:center">What Sets Us Apart</h3>
        <p id="parastyle">
            The internet is bigger than most people think,
             but it’s still difficult to stand out in the 
            crowd. That’s why we do things a little bit
            differently at Big Edition. You won’t find the 
            same old, same old here. We go long when others 
            go short. We go deep when others just scratch 
            the surface. We go original when everyone else 
            recycles the same old news. Now more than ever,
             it’s important to sidestep the media circus and 
             give people unexpected stories that get at the 
             heart of what matters. With our five brands, 
             we uncover the hidden topics audiences want but 
             are hard to find. When everyone else is talking 
             to the hero, we find the unsung hero and tell
              that story. This unique, organic approach 
              allows us to engage with a large audience and
               create a loyal community with shared
                interests.
